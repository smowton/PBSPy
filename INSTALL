 INSTALLATION
===============================================================================

 PREREQUISTES
 ------------
  
  - Python 2.5.1 or above (see setup.py for version below that and above 2.2.3)
  - Torque/OpenPBS installation (will work with PBSPro too minus the extensions)

 QUICKSTART GUIDE
 -----------------

  Edit the setup.cfg and change the neccessary parameters in the [pbs_config] section.
  Things you might want to change are:

    include_dirs
    library_dirs
    libraries
    enable_rm           (MUST have rm.h  in the include search directory)
    enable_log          (MUST have log.h in the include search directory)

  After that it is the standard distutils commands

  $ python setup.py build

  and then to install

  $ python setup.py install

  Or you can pass the options in the command line, you have to invoke the pbs_config
  command and pass the options there as they are not "inherited".

  $ python setup.py pbs_config --enable-rm --enable-log build -f 
                    ^^^^^^^^^^                          ^^^^^
                    ||||||||||                          |||||

                    (command_1) (opts for command_1)    (command_2) (opts for command_2)
